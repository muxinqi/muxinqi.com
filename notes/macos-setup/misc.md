# Misc

Some other stuff


## Setup dev folder

I used to manage code related stuff in this folder

```shell
mkdir ~/Developer
```

> The icon is provided by the system, which is very sweet.

## Enable key repeating

e.g. IntelliJ IDEA IdeaVim

```shell
defaults write com.jetbrains.intellij ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```
